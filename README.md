# AutomaticTorrents
[WIP] Automatically add &amp; download torrents over VPN, then rename &amp; move them

## Important
This project is in very early stages and is barely functional. Currently, only a Transmission web client is available.

You should not deploy this. If you would like something similar, try [docker-transmission-openvpn](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn).

Only NordVPN is supported for now. Custom OpenVPN configuration will be available soon.

OpenVPN code adapted from [openvpn-client](https://github.com/dperson/openvpn-client) under the AGPL 3.0 license, as is this project.
